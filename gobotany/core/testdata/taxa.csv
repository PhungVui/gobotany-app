It holds on to its toothed, golden-brown leaves very late into the winter. Beech suckers readily, so a ""mother"" tree may be surrounded by dozens of its identical offspring saplings. Today, mature trees are falling victim to a Nectria fungus that blisters the bark and weakens the tree. Beech nuts become available en masse during mast fruiting events, when they become a very important food source for birds, at one time including millions of the now-extinct passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius). While the tough wood of beech is not much used by woodworkers, the smooth bark beckons to graffitti artists, poets, and adventurers as illustrious as Virgil (who wrote an ode to beech) and Daniel Boone (who marked his progress westward by inscriptions on the trees).","Peattie, D.

In wet green places 'twixt the depth and height
Dost keep thine hour while Autumn ebbs away,
When now the moors have doffed the heather bright,

How gladly with the unpermitted bay-
Garlands not mine, and leaves that not decay-
How gladly would I twine thee if I might!

The bays are out of reach! But far below
The peaks forbidden of the Muses' Hill,
Grass of Parnassus, thy returning snow
Between September and October chill
Doth speak to me of Autumns long ago,
And these kind faces that are with me still.

It is an attractive wildflower, whose shiny red fruits make it a great addition to the native plant garden. There is a much less common white-fruited form (Actaea rubra var. neglecta).
