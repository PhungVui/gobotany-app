GO BOTANY: ABOUT SVG MAP FILES

There are two sets of SVG maps in this directory:

1. Master: Files originally obtained from Wikipedia Commons, with various
tweaks made in Inkscape.

- new-england-counties.svg
- us-counties.svg

2. Scoured: Files resulting from running the master files through an
open-source Python SVG cleanup script called Scour, available at:
    http://www.codedread.com/scour/
These scoured files are NOT editable in Inkscape.

- new-england-counties-scoured.svg
- us-counties-scoured.svg

EDITING THE MAPS

If you need to edit the map files, do so on the master versions and then
generate new scoured versions by running Scour.

RUNNING SCOUR

Run scour.py one file at a time. Set the -i switch to the master input
filename and the -o switch to the scoured output filename. Include the
following configuration options for the Go Botany maps. The command should
look like this (all on one line):

$ python scour.py -i us-counties.svg -o us-counties-scoured.svg
--disable-style-to-xml --indent=none --set-precision=4
--enable-comment-stripping
