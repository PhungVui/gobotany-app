                    <h1>Dichotomous Key</h1>
                    <p>This key will cover all 3,500 species, subspecies, and
                    varieties of native and naturalized plants in New
                    England, and is designed for experienced botanists.</p>
                    <p>It allows you to choose characteristics which match your
                    plant from a series of paired options, eventually honing in
                    on the indivdual species.</p>
                    <p>We are completing data input for all these taxa, and the
                    Dichotomous Key will be available in late 2012. Check back
                    soon!</p>
