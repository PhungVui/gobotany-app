                    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                    <p>Go Botany is designed to gather and disseminate 
                    information about plant distribution and abundance 
                    across the six states of New England, USA, and 
                    adjacent provinces and states.  This privacy policy 
                    governs the use of personal information from the site 
                    and you agree to be bound to this policy as a user of 
                    the Site.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>Submitted Information</h4>
                    <p>Personal Information is voluntarily supplied by you 
                    when you register and submit data to the <a 
                    href="{% url plantshare-placeholder %}">PlantShare</a> sector 
                    of the Site. By registering at PlantShare, you allow us to 
                    associate your plant observations with a unique identifier 
                    (login name or your name), so that you can track your 
                    personal observations (e.g., checklists and customized 
                    maps). Profile Information allows us to gain a better 
                    understanding of the PlantShare participants and Go Botany 
                    visitors and to determine how best to improve the web site 
                    for Go Botany users.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>You are able to view your personal observations (plant 
                    sightings, postings, and questions to the Botanist) and 
                    those of others (if they have made them available to you, 
                    your affinity group, or the web), so please be aware that 
                    your observations of species and their locations plus an 
                    supporting information you provide, may be available to 
                    other PlantShare users.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Plant observations are the most important pieces of 
                    information that we collect. Details of a plant sighting 
                    and its associated location (species, numbers, etc.) are 
                    available only to the users designated by you as a 
                    PlantShare member, which you choose upon uploading a 
                    sighting to the Site.  Only information pertaining to 
                    plant observations is available to your selected users; 
                    no personal contact information is ever made public.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Cookies are pieces of data that we store on your 
                    computer to tie your information to the PlantShare 
                    program. Cookies allow you to store your login 
                    information, so that you will not be required to log 
                    in each time you visit the PlantShare web site.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Internet browsers allow you to determine whether 
                    or not to accept cookies (check under the preferences 
                    or options in the browser menu). If you decide not to 
                    accept cookies, you can still use the PlantShare site, 
                    but you will need to re-enter login information each 
                    time you visit.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>Sensitive Species</h4>
                    <p>If you submit an unusual observation or a sighting of a 
                    plant known to be listed as Endangered, Threatened, 
                    Special Concern, Historic or Invasive in a New England 
                    state, we may e-mail you to request more details and to 
                    confirm your sighting.  Your email address and contact 
                    information will not be sold or distributed outside New 
                    England Wild Flower Society.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>Your practices in obtaining sightings</h4>
                    <p>As a conservation organization, New England Wild Flower 
                    Society seeks to limit disturbance to plants, especially 
                    those that are rare or occur on private property. Please 
                    do not trespass on private property to observe plants; 
                    always obtain landowner permission before gathering data 
                    on plants and posting sightings from private property.
                    By posting a sighting, you are agreeing that all applicable 
                    landowner permissions have been obtained and that posting 
                    of locational and other data has been approved by the 
                    landowner.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h4>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>
                    <p>We may occasionally update or amend New England Wild 
                    Flower Societyâ€™s Privacy Statement. If we make changes, 
                    we will post the changes here.</p>
