                    <p>This key will cover all 3500 species, subspecies, and
                    varieties of native and naturalized plants in New
                    England.</p><br />
                    <p>It works in the same way as our Simple Key Plant
                    Identifier, asking you to choose the broad group your plant
                    is in, then offering you a series of questions based on the
                    characteristics you are able to observe.  Because there are
                    many types of plants in this key, you may take a little
                    longer to identify your plant, but once you do, you can get
                    lots of information on each taxon.</p><br />
                    <p>We are completing data input for all these taxa, and the
                    Full Key will be available in Fall 2012. Check back
                    soon!</p><br />
